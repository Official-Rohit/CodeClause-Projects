These are my projects done with codeclause during my data science internship.
First project is about house price prediction using linear regression model in python.
Second project is about calculating clustomer lifetime value prediction using polynomial regression model in python.
Third and my golden project is about credit default prediction using Neural networks model, keras, and final deployment with flask in python.
